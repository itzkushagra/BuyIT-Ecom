lazy loading- it helps in= loads the components only when the user
clicks on them. Otherwise all components will be loaded causing optimization issues.

Backend:
  npm init
  npm i -g typescript
  tsc --init
  npm i express dotenv mongoose
  npm i --save-dev @types/express @types/node typ
  npm i --save-dev nodemon
  tsc (makes the dis folder containing app.js)

Script Commands:
  "start": "node dist/app.js",   (this initiates the project)
  "build": "tsc",                (this builds the project) 
  "watch": "tsc -w"              (this makes changes simultaneously in dist\app.js when changes                                       are made in app.ts)

In the terminal of app.ts run "npm run watch", then it will show watching for file changes.
"dev": "nodemon dist/app.js" (add it in scripts)
After that open another terminal parallely and type run dev
| Now whatever changes you will make in app.ts will be reflected in the app.js |
